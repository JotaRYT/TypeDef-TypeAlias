# C++ Program with `typedef` and Type Aliases

**Make sure to not skip the theory before doing practise.**

In this lesson, we’ll do **typedef** in C++ and **Type Aliases**. What's those porpuse? Accelerate the development process and making the code easier to read.

## Concepts

- **`typedef`**: This keyword allows you to create an alias for an existing data type. It can be particularly useful when working with long or complex type names. The alias helps you reduce the number of chars.


### Type Aliases

In the program, we define two type aliases:

```cpp
typedef std::string string_t;   // Alias for std::string
typedef std::int16_t number_t;  // Alias for std::int16_t
```

## Wrapping Up

By the end of this lesson, you’ll have learned:
- How to use typedef
- Accelerate the process of C++ development
- Enhance the readibility of the code

Merry christmas!!!!
